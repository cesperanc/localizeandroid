# Introduction #
localizeandroid's chief goal is to provide a location-based service that manages a set of personally added locations (e.g.: country, city, tourism-related place, store, school, classroom,…). Users are able to manage the properties of the locations, including tags that enable a refined search mechanism. A visual-search display of a map with the search results is also available.

This is an academic android project, developed in the context of the course Software Engineering II at Escola Superior de Tecnologia e Gestão do Instituto Politécnico de Leiria.

# Topics covered in the application #
  * How to copy items from the assets folder to the SD card on the device and start the media indexing service to share items to the gallery
  * How to integrate the application within the global search
  * How to create a loader using a thread
  * How to implement a dual search mode using a splitview with a result and map list
  * How to implement context and options menus
  * How to create a database layer (with triggers and a virtual table for the unified search) to store the application data
  * How to create an advanced search mechanism using the match from the SQLite
  * How to create multiple overlays to set a GPS position on a map
  * How to create a popup over a map
  * How to integrate your application with the android media gallery
  * Among other things
